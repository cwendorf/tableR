\usage{
style_box(formatted, caption = NULL, space = c(1, 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{formatted}{A `tableR` object (or `tableR_list`) to be styled as a box table.
This object is typically created by `format_table()` and contains attributes for alignment,
width, row names, and captions.}

\item{caption}{Optional character string to include as a caption above the table.
If `NULL`, uses the `caption` attribute from the `formatted` object, if available.}

\item{space}{Integer vector of length 1 or 2 indicating the number of blank lines
to add before and after the table output. If length 1, that number is used for both.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a character vector of the formatted table lines.
  Also prints the styled table directly to the console.
}
\description{
Formats a `tableR` object as a text table with box-style borders using ASCII characters.
This style includes horizontal and vertical lines surrounding the table, column headers,
and rows, with proper padding and alignment for each column.
}
